# SocketDice: Networked Dice Game Adventure

Welcome to **SocketDice**, a multiplayer dice game that brings the concepts of Computer Networks (CN) and the Internet of Things (IoT) into a fun and interactive gaming experience! This project is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of networking, client-server communication, and concurrency in a hands-on, engaging way. If you've ever wondered how applications communicate over a network, this game will give you a practical and enjoyable insight into the magic that happens behind the scenes.

## üß† **Why This Project Matters**

Networking is the backbone of modern applications. From chat applications to online gaming, understanding how data travels between devices is crucial for any aspiring computer scientist or developer. **SocketDice** provides a window into this world by demonstrating how multiple players can connect over a network, communicate through messages, and interact in real-time using socket programming.

By implementing this project, you'll gain valuable experience with:
- Client-server architecture
- Concurrency and multi-threading
- Real-time message passing
- The practical application of socket programming

Through this game, you‚Äôll learn not just the technical concepts, but also how they come together to create a seamless interactive experience.

## üéØ **Project Objectives**

The main objectives of this project are to:
1. **Implement a multiplayer dice game** using socket programming in C, showcasing the concept of client-server communication over a network.
2. **Demonstrate client-server architecture** where the server manages the game logic and the clients act as players.
3. **Utilize concurrency** to handle multiple client connections, allowing the server to manage multiple game sessions simultaneously.
4. Provide a **hands-on understanding of networking concepts** such as sockets, message passing, and bidirectional data transfer.

## üîç **Simulation Example**

### How It Works

1. **Server Start-Up**: The server starts and waits for incoming client connections.
2. **Client Connection**: Two clients (players) connect to the server.
3. **Gameplay**: The server alternates turns between the two clients, allowing them to roll a dice and accumulate their scores.
4. **Winning the Game**: The first player to reach a total score of 100 is declared the winner, and the server ends the game.

### Example Steps with Screenshots

**Step 1: Server Waiting for Clients**

The server starts and waits for clients to connect.

Two clients, Player 1 (TOTO) and Player 2 (TITI), connect to the server.

**Step 2: Gameplay Begins**

The server sends the "You can now play" message to Player 1. Player 1 rolls the dice, and the score is sent back to the server.

Next, it's Player 2's turn. The server sends the "You can now play" message to Player 2, and Player 2 rolls the dice.

Once a player reaches a score of 100, the server declares the winner. In this example, Player 2 wins the game.
